IMPLEMENT 2 TECHNIQUES:
1.Backtracking - for week 5
2. Dynamic Programming - for week 6
backtracking: 3
dynamic: 2
------------------------------------
1.Backtracking:
- implement it in 2 ways: recursive and iterative
- solve a problem in the 2 ways
- lecture on teams
- explain the time complexity for the solution

2. Dynamic
-implement it dynamic and normally
