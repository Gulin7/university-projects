MAC - 6 BYTES, FARA LITERE PESTE F
- guaranteed to be unique , not routable, can be changed, understood by switch but not by hub
- determined by arp , when ip is known; 
-------------------
COMPUTATIONAL
CHECK IP/NM VALID => Binary both IP and NM. Where u have 0 in NM you must have 0 in IP
--
IP + NM => NA = IP && NM | BA = IP || (!NM)
---
NetMask given => hosts: 2^(nr 0)-2 | subnets: 31-(nr 1)
----
can be broadcast address => 4k-1 | can be network address => 4k
----
2^(30-x) = number of /30 subnets that can be made from /x
----
how many subnets with minim dim contain 2 addresses: find how many bits are the same from left to right(ex 7)
find how many addresses can u have on that subnet mask ( ex 2^22)
=> 2^(32-22-7) = 8
-------------------
IP ADDRESS CLASSES:
A - 1.x.x.x-127.x.x.x/8 | B - 128.x.x.x->191.x.x.x/16 | C - 192-223/24 | D 224-239 multicast | E-240-255 experimental
-------------------
Private IPs    ---- 127.0.0.1 - loopback addr
192.168.x.x /<=16     |     10.x.x.x/<=8   |    172.16.0.0-172.31.x.x /<=12
-----------------
TCP: SOCK_STREAM
tcp header = 20
TCP HEADER = DCP HEADER + 12 BYTES (length)
TCP Header - Source/Dest port, seq num, ack numb, flags, data offset, checksum, urgent pointer
- hhtp, ftp, stmp - email
--------------------
UDP:   SOCK_DGRAM
UDP packets - encapsulated in IP datagram | HEADER = 8
-------------------
deci daca am x.x.y.d
x.x.z.d
fac y-z<=2^caca
mask = 255.255.(256-2^caca).0
--------------------
COMMANDS:
SERVER - accept, bind 
TCP server - bind mandatory, connect not mandatory, listen not mandatory, accept mandatory
UDP server - connect not mandatory, bind mandatory
recvfrom() doesnt send data to the tcp server
NO ACCEPT IN UDP SERVER
CLIENT - nothing mandatory
Client - socket, listen, connect | bind - not mandatory , can be in tcp/udp, accept not mandatory
sendto() sends data to udp client
recvfrom() reads data from UDP client; the client doesnt get data from recvfrom() call
listen => accepts incoming requests; signalled by making socket passive
UDP NO CONNECT !!! no connect
TCP MUST HAVE CONNECT AND ACCEPT
---
no: udp client -connect ; udp server no accept;
mandatory: tcp client connect and accept; tcp server bind and accept; udp server bind;
recvfrom() reads from udp clients and sendto - sends to client
-----------------
APP LAYERs: dns, ssh, ftp, http, smtp
Pres layer | session layer | transp layer = udp, tcp, https | netw layer = ip | data link = mac | phys
- OSI 
TCP/IP - 4 layers
--------------------
IP(v4)
IP addr - 32bits/4bytes; first ip addr = network addr<----->broadcast adr =last ip address
----
IP Protocol - unreliable, affects packet routing, defines the internet addressing sys
offset field - order of fragments | ICMP = Internet control message protocvol
IP routing is based on Destination Ip | ICMP packets are encapsulated within IP datagrams
-------------------
RIP = Routing Information Protocol
RIPv1 - same timers as v2; supports classless routing protocols; not < admin dist RIPV2; not easier to config
RIPv2 - maximum metric(hop count) of 15; >15 = unreachable
-------------------
Optical fiber - light waves, no limit in bandwith | wifi - electromagnetic waves
-------------------
CHECKSUM - ip header - computed on each router and source/dest hosts
a 16bit field used on header for error checking
-----------------
DHCP= clinet/sv protocol that provides an ip host with its ip address, subnetmask and gateway
------------------
Switch > hub, switch - mac addr, sends to one, not to all; both have multiple ports
switches can transport tcp packets & ip packets & udp packets
------------------
DOMAIN: (not every not used domain is free to claim)
ana.are.mere.ro => ro = top level dom; mere subdom of ro, are subdom of mere.ro; ana subdom of are.mere.ro
------------------
TLD = Top Level Domain | ARP =Addr Res Prot | FTP = File Trans Prot | DHCP = Dyn Host Config Prot |
DNS= Dom Name Sys | ROTLD = Rom Top Lvl Dom | UDP = User Datagr Prot | TCP = Trans Contr Prot |
P2P = Peer to Peer |  ISP = Internet Serv Provider  | LAN = Local Area Network |  MAC = Media Access Control
NAT = Network Address Translation | HTTP = HyperText Transfer Protocol | DSL = Digital Subscriber Line
SSH = Secure Shell | CLI= command line interface
-------------------
Bus - newtork topology = single cable that connects in series all computers from network
Star - network topology - Ring
---------------------
TTL = Time To Live -> number of routers the packet is allowed to pass
------------------------------
Computer to switch =  straight-through cable | PC to router = Cross-over cable
------------------
SMB or SAMBA Protocol is a file transfer protocol
------------------
Bandwidth = amount of data that can be carried in a given time; physical property of the transm medium
throughput = quantity of data over quantity of time which we send at a given time, through a trans channel
-----------------
listen system call = used by a sv process; indicates that sv is ready to accept incoming conections on the socket
- accept with "accept"
------------------
Congestion window = sender impose window - avoid overrunning routers in a network path
below threshold -> grow exponentially | above threshold -> grow lineary
-------------------
Datagram = basic transfer unit used in packet-switched netws, providing a connectionless comm service
------------------
++Routing Table: Interface, netmask, destination address, gateway
+ISP aggregates smaller networks into a larger one to reduce numb of entries in routing table of the router connecting the ISP to the Internet  | HTTP +transfers encrypted data + client to sv with telnet
++Traceroute shows all IPs of the routers parsed until the current IP
+Ping uses the Protocol ICMP 
++arp /a 
check datalink layer
+NAT - causes loss of end-to-end IP traceability | configure NAT-static,dynamic, NAT overload
++Protocol defines when/how/what data is communicated
+Supernetting - 2^(net-supernet)
++DNS - can be def gateway - it's main function is to provide host names to TCP/IP addr res | runs on port 53 on both udp and tcp
+ FTP - uses data and control channels | doesnt provide encryption | on application layer
++ network adapter mac addr => ipconfig /all
+Whois Query -> domain name is already bought
++Duplicate ack-> NO congest win cut in half/cut in half & grow exp/set to 1mss
+Classless routing protocol -> supported by RIPv2 only, variable length mask and discontiguous netw
++ Internet API - set of rules that the sending program must follow - for delivery to destination program
+ localhost is 127.0.0.1, also the loopback address
++ AFTER translation=>  Inside Global Host | Before Translation=> Outside Local Host
+SSH- app layer
++Computers can have more than one ip address
+UDP - not ALWAYS FASTER than TCP | udp is process to process
++UDP- reads bytes from a packet, tcp writes stream of bytes(doesnt read) (?)
+ Hub shares bandwidth

INTREBARI:
1.A company has three departments: Offices, Public and Managers. The offices have 123 computers, Public Relationship has 29 computers and Managers have 5 computers. The company wants to make a network such that: - every computer has access to the internet - have minimum costs - it must be certainly known from which department some webpages are accessed from the HQ in another city Provide a good configuration for these requirements:
a) 3 subnetworks, 192.168.0.0/24, 192.168.1.0/24, 192.168.2.0/24 for every department and connect every subnet directly to the internet, using NAT, through a different provider
b) 1 subnetwork for all the company, 192.168.0.0/24, connect computers to internet through a router which translates every address IP to a public IP address with different class depending on department
c) 3 subnetworks, 192.168.0.0/25, 192.168.0.128/27, 192.168.0.160/29, one router which translates the first network to 30.0.0.1, second to 30.0.0.2, and third to 30.0.0.3
d) 3 subnetworks, 192.168.0.0/25, 192.168.0.128/27, 192.168.0.160/29 and connect them to a central router which translates all the IPs on 192.168.0.0/24 with the IP 30.0.0.5
