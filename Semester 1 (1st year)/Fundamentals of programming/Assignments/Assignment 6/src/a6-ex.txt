functions.py
ui.py
start.py
functions can't call ui!
--------------
have 10 random elements at the beginning of the list

you have a list of lists or a list of dictionaries

write automatic tests with assert:
for all functions in functions.py related to A and B
(the first 2 sets of functionalities out of the 5)
