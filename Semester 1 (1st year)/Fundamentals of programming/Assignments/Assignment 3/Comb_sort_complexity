                                        COMB SORT

    The comb sort is essentially an improved bubble sort, that works by comparing the elements at a gap size more than 1:
the gap starts at a large value and shrinks at 1.3 rate with each iteration, until it reaches one.

    The best case scenario:
    O(n log(n)), when the list is already sorted: the first iteration will make n/1.3 comparisons, then n/(1.3)^2, then
n/(1.3)^3 and so on, until it reaches <=1. That sum is:
n*Sum(1/1.3)^r, r going from 1 to n( The harmonic number)= n*log(n).

    The worst case scenario:
    O(n^2), when the list is sorted in reverse order(same as the bubble sort).
